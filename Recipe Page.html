    <h1>Pancakes with cheese</h1>
    <p>I fry these egg and cheese pancakes up on an electric griddle.  Just like a regular pancake, I wait for the edges to start to bubble and flip them.  Both sides should be nicely golden browned.  Serve these hot, right off the griddle.  Top with a small dollop of sour cream or eat as is.
    That’s it.  Quick, easy and delicious.  This has always been a family favorite and I’m sure we’ll be eating it a lot more frequently with the flux of eggs we’ll have.  You can season these pancakes up however you like, add some fresh herbs, finely diced veggies or perhaps some crumbled bacon –  this is a wonderful recipe to get creative with!
    Thanks so much for stopping by!  I do hope you enjoy this recipe and I’d love to hear all about it!  Happy Cooking!</p>
